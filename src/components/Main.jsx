              Hi, I'm Gustavo a front end developer from Brazil, I'm studying a bachelor's degree in computer science, and in addition to web development that as my principal field, I'm also a studying postgraduated in Software engineer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Among my hardskills I usually work with a few frameworks and technologies as
              reactjs,
              and now I learning Typescript and nodeJs to build more complex applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              I already have work experience where I was able to develop many of my softskills such as teamwork,
               communication,
                 leadership,
                 time management
                  and quality control during the creation processes.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               All this was possible because I have to work with many teams from different sectors so I always need to interact and talk to others peoples.
            </p>
            <p>
               I am sure that I can be the best candidate for this opportunity, because I learn quickly, adapt easily to changes, I love learning new things and working in different parts of a project.
            </p>
            <p>
               I'm determined person in my goals and always work hard to overcome challenges. So I believe that I can do too much as part of your team.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               Well that's a little about me and I hope to meet you very soon.  Goodbye
